# Weekly-Reminder

If you need to get a bunch of people to do something once a week, but not necessarily at the same time, try this out!

Make a Google Form with a single radio button that affirms that someone did something that week. The corresponding spreadsheet that houses responses should have a timestamp as its first column and the submitter's email address as the second column. Your affirmation will be in the third column.

Add the corresponding script and set a daily runtime. The script will check whether someone has submitted a response in the past week. If they have not, it will send them an edmail reminder to affirm that they have and pester them daily until they fill it out, to follow up in a week's time.
